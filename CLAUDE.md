# MixerM8

A read-only bridge from a Behringer X32 Compact to a booth tablet, plus the
tablet app itself. Volunteers at the desk get a guide that follows whatever
screen the mixer is showing.

## The one rule

**Nothing in this repo may ever write to the console.** A volunteer's Sunday
depends on it. The guarantee is structural, not a convention:

- `osc.encode_query(address)` is the *only* encoder, and it accepts no
  arguments. On the X32, an argument-less message is a read.
- `ALLOWED_PATTERNS` in `osc.py` matches full addresses, not prefixes.
- `tests/test_osc.py::test_only_one_socket_send_exists_in_the_package` pins the
  number of `sendto()` calls at two and asserts both go through `encode_query`.

If a task seems to need an argument sent to the desk, stop and raise it rather
than widening the encoder. `/node` is unsupported for exactly this reason.

## Architecture

| Path            | What it is                              | Ships via                      |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| `docs/`         | The tablet app (vanilla HTML/CSS/JS)    | GitHub Pages + bundled in wheel |
| `src/mixerm8/`  | The bridge (stdlib only)                | PyPI + PyInstaller exe         |
| `content/`      | Source material, shipped nowhere        | —                              |
| `packaging/`    | PyInstaller spec, Windows install script | —                             |

`docs/` has **two** delivery paths from one copy of the files. Pages serves it
directly; hatchling `force-include` copies it into the wheel as
`mixerm8/webroot`, and the PyInstaller spec bundles it as `webroot`.
`server.webroot()` resolves all three cases. Do not duplicate these files.

**GitHub Pages cannot host the live booth page.** It is HTTPS, and an HTTPS page
may not open `http://`/`ws://` connections to a LAN address — mixed content.
This is why the bridge serves its own copy, and why the app auto-detects
"bridge" vs "reference" mode instead of being configured. Any proposal to have
the Pages copy talk to the bridge runs into this; don't re-litigate it.

## Three stations, and where the console sits

The guide is the product; the console bridge is an add-on. Keep it that way —
two of the three stations have no console at all.

| Station | Data file | Tabs |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `audio` | `docs/data/audio.json` | Before · Problems · Order · Mixer |
| `media` | `docs/data/media.json` | Before · Problems · Order |
| `livestream` | `docs/data/livestream.json` | Before · Problems · Order |

Each station file carries `checklist`, `problems` and `flow`. Two layers by
design: the checklist is for the volunteer who has done this before, the
problem pages are for the one who has not. Problem titles are *symptoms*
("Someone is too quiet"), never component names ("Gate") — a page called
"Gate" only helps someone who already knows the word, and that person is not
who the layer is for. `test_the_problem_pages_are_problem_shaped` guards it.

Routing is the hash, because a QR sticker is the whole user interface:
`#<role>` and `#<role>/<lang>`, with `en`, `ko` and `both`. A bare URL is the
station picker, which is also the tablet's home screen. Changing station
resets to the checklist; changing only the language does not, so cycling
EN/KO does not lose someone's place.

**The checklist is always the landing view, and the Mixer tab never is.** A
station has to work with the bridge dead, so the first thing a volunteer sees
must not depend on a UDP reply. The Mixer tab is present for `audio` whether
or not a bridge answered — the screen guides are worth reading on a Tuesday —
but only the follow row inside it depends on the bridge.

## Content is two-layered, for privacy

The committed `docs/data/*.json` are a **generic example**.
A church's real wording goes in a sibling `*.local.json`, which the app
prefers and `.gitignore` excludes. Three resolution points, one convention:

- `app.js:loadData()` tries `data/<name>.local.json`, then `data/<name>.json`.
  On Pages the first simply 404s.
- `server.override_dir()` maps `/data/*.local.json` to
  `%APPDATA%/MixerM8/data/`, so a media director can reword the guide without
  git, a rebuild, or a reinstall. Restricted to a single `*.json` filename on
  purpose — it must not become a second file server.
- A gitignored `docs/data/*.local.json` also works in a source checkout.

This exists because a filled-in guide names a staff member and lists the
channel layout. Do not add site-specific text to the committed example files;
that publishes it.

**Unfilled values are blanks, never guesses.** A run of four or more
underscores renders as a visible gap (`fill()` in `app.js`), and the entry
carries a bilingual `todo` saying what is missing.
`test_a_blank_is_never_silent` pins the pairing: a blank without a `todo`
fails the suite. The reason is concrete — the flow used to instruct volunteers
to load "the Sunday scene", which nobody had confirmed exists, and loading the
wrong scene resets every fader mid-service.

## Constraints

- **No runtime dependencies.** `dependencies = []` is deliberate: it keeps
  `pip install` trivial and the frozen exe small. Transport is Server-Sent
  Events precisely because it needs no library. Adding a dependency needs a
  reason worth stating in the commit message.
- **No build step for the app.** `docs/` is hand-written, loads its content from
  `docs/data/*.json`, and uses relative URLs so it works at both `/` (bridge)
  and `/mixerm8/` (Pages). No bundler, no npm, no framework.
- **The tablet is the target.** 19px base, dark-only (a white screen blinds the
  operator in a dim booth), 52px minimum tap targets, English and Korean.

## Commands

```bash
pip install -e ".[dev]"    # stdlib only at runtime; this adds pytest + ruff
pytest                     # 33 tests, ~3s
ruff check .               # line length 100
mixerm8 --discover         # find consoles on the network
python -m http.server -d docs 8000   # the app in reference mode, no mixer
```

Testing without a desk: `tests/fake_x32.py` is that UDP responder. It answers
the three `/-stat` queries, walks a script of screens (including tab 9, which
is deliberately unmapped so the "not mapped yet" path gets exercised), and
asserts every inbound packet has an empty typetag. Run it standalone against
a real bridge and browser, or let `tests/test_integration.py` drive it
in-process — that is where the read-only guarantee is verified end to end,
from where the desk stands rather than from our own code.

## Gotchas

- `CHAN_PAGES` in `console.py` is **unverified against real hardware.** Unmapped
  numbers surface in the UI as "not mapped yet" on purpose; that is the
  discovery mechanism, not a bug to hide.
- The X32 drops `/xremote` subscribers after ~10s, hence `RESUBSCRIBE_EVERY = 8`.
- Version lives in `pyproject.toml` and `src/mixerm8/__init__.py`. Bump both.
- The exe can only be built on Windows, so `.github/workflows/release.yml` is
  load-bearing rather than a nicety — a tag push is the only way to ship a build.
- `Console.snapshot()` is compared by value to decide whether to push an SSE
  frame, so adding a field that changes every tick would flood every tablet.
  `last_seen` is popped for exactly this reason.
- **Open questions that gate content**, all of them currently blanks in the
  example files rather than invented values: whether this desk uses scenes and
  which is safe to load (gates the EQ and Scenes wording), the channel/label
  layout, which software runs the livestream PC, the power-on order for the
  camera chain, and who to escalate to. Ask; do not fill these in.
